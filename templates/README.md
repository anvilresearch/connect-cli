# Anvil Connect

### Running in Docker Containers

This generated project provides support for Redis, Anvil Connect, and nginx. To
run a complete, production-ready set of containers you can use Docker Compose.
First, you'll want to ensure a few things.

#### Warning for Boot2Docker Users
If you're running on a Mac or Windows computer using boot2docker (this includes
kitematic and docker-toolbox), then you must ensure that the project folder is
located somewhere underneath ```/Users/``` on OS/X or ```c:\Users\``` on Windows.
This is because boot2docker by default can only map subdirectories of these
folders into the Docker containers.

If the project folder exists within your home directory or your ```Documents```
folder, then it will work fine.

If you must locate the project folder elsewhere, see this
[StackOverlow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30586949/how-do-i-map-volume-outside-c-users-to-container-on-windows)
for a possible procedure.

#### IP Address

If you're running on Linux, the IP address Connect will be bound to is localhost
and/or the IP of your computer/server. Once the containers are running, you
should be able to reach the service at `https://0.0.0.0`.

On Mac and other systems you may need to install boot2docker in order to run
Docker containers locally. Once you've installed boot2docker, you can obtain
the IP address of your local Docker host by running:

```bash
boot2docker ip
```

#### /etc/hosts

To work with your Anvil Connect instance locally, it's a good idea to make an
entry in your `/etc/hosts` file. For example, on a Mac, you'll want to associate
the (sub)domain you provided the generator with `boot2docker` IP address.

```bash
192.168.59.103 connect.example.io
```

#### RSA Key Pair


#### SSL Certificate

When you ran `nv init`, you may have opted to generate a self-signed SSL
certificate. The files were created in the `nginx/certs` directory of this
project. If you did not opt to generate these files, you'll need to provide
your own `nginx.key` and `nginx.crt` files.


#### Start Anvil Connect

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stop

```
$ docker-compose stop [connect|nginx|redis]
```

#### Restart

```
$ docker-compose restart
```

#### View Logs

```
$ docker-compose logs <connect|nginx|redis>
```


### Building Custom Containers

By default, Docker Compose is configured to use images provided by Anvil
Research on Docker Hub. You can build images yourself by commenting out the
`image` property of a service in `docker-compose.yml` and uncommenting the
`build` property like so:

```yaml
connect:
  build: connect
  #image: anvilresearch/connect
  ...
```

While we highly recommend using the official images or provided Dockerfiles, if
necessary you can modify them to suit your requirements. You can also push your
own custom images to Docker Hub and use them to run Connect by referencing them
in the `image` property in `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
connect:
  #build: connect
  image: <dockerhubusername>/connect
```
